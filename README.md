## 📚 About the Course

This course provides an introduction to the fundamental concepts, tools, and strategies in operations management, 
focusing on how organizations design, manage, and improve their processes to match supply with demand. 
Students will begin by learning how to model and analyze processes, evaluate capacity, and address variability and queueing effects. 
The course then builds toward inventory management under both deterministic and uncertain demand, 
incorporating models such as EOQ, newsvendor, and order-up-to. 
After the midterm, students will explore forecasting techniques, risk pooling, and revenue management, 
followed by supply chain fundamentals, coordination mechanisms, and performance drivers. 
The final weeks focus on quality management, lean operations, and project management, equipping students with
a broad set of analytical and managerial skills to diagnose operational challenges and implement effective solutions.
By the end of the semester, students will be able to:
- Understand foundational principles of operations and supply chain management  
- Apply analytical tools to improve business processes  
- Evaluate trade-offs in operational decision-making  
- Communicate managerial insights

### UB Learns
- The primary platform for this course is [UB Learns](http://ublearns.buffalo.edu/), which will serve as the central hub for course content, announcements, and grading.  
- Please familiarize yourself with UB Learns. You can explore its features and guides at [UB Learns Student Guide](https://www.buffalo.edu/lms/guides-students.html#title_0_copy:~:text=Quick%20Start%20Videos-,Available%20Guides,-Basics%20of%20UB)

### Zoom

### Generative AI
Generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) can support your learning, but they must be used **ethically and responsibly**. 

✅ **Permitted Uses**  
- Clarifying course concepts or terminology.  
- Brainstorming ideas, examples, or alternative approaches.  
- Practicing with additional problems or quizzes generated by AI.  
- Improving clarity, grammar, or formatting of your own writing.  

🚫 **Not Permitted**  
- Using AI to complete homework, quizzes, or exams.  
- Submitting any AI output as your own original work.  
- Using AI to generate code, formulas, or problem solutions you do not fully understand.  

⚠️ **Required Practice**  
- **Attempt first:** Always create your own draft or solution before using AI.  
- **Ask specifically:** Use AI to answer targeted questions or explain concepts, not to “do the work.”  
- **Acknowledge use:** Whenever you use an AI tool, include a brief *AI Use Statement* in your submission.  
  For example:  
  > I used ChatGPT to clarify the definition of the EOQ formula.  
- **Verification:** The instructor and student assistant may use AI-detection tools to help determine whether submitted work is AI-generated or written by the student. Misrepresenting AI-generated work as your own is considered academic fraud. Read more at the [UB Academic Integrity – Artificial Intelligence](https://www.buffalo.edu/academic-integrity/about/artificial-intelligence.html) page.
